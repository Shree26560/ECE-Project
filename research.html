        <h1><u>Sudden rise in food wastage</u></h1>
        <br>
        <p>Food wastage is a global issue that has gained increasing attention in recent years due to a sudden and concerning rise in the amount of food being discarded. This growing problem has far-reaching consequences on the environment, economy, and social equity, making it imperative to understand the factors contributing to this issue.</p>
        <br>
        <p><u>Causes:</u></p>
        <h5><u>Consumer Behavior:</u></h5>
        <p>One of the primary causes of food wastage is consumer behavior. With the convenience of fast-food delivery services and the availability of pre-packaged meals, consumers often buy more than they can consume, resulting in a significant amount of edible food ending up in the trash. Additionally, the lack of awareness about food expiration dates and improper storage practices contribute to unnecessary waste.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h5><u> Retail Practices:</u></h5>
        <p>Retailers play a crucial role in food wastage. Supermarkets and restaurants often overstock shelves and serve oversized portions. The pressure to maintain a pristine appearance of products on the shelves leads to the discarding of perfectly edible items as they approach their sell-by dates. Additionally, cosmetic standards for fruits and vegetables result in the rejection of produce that doesn't meet specific visual criteria.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h5><u>Supply Chain Issues:</u></h5>
        <p>Food wastage can occur at various stages of the supply chain, from farm to table. Losses due to transportation inefficiencies, inadequate storage facilities, and inadequate processing are significant contributors to the problem. Crops can go unsold, get damaged during transit, or rot in storage due to logistical challenges.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h5><u>Socioeconomic Factors:</u></h5>
        <p>Socioeconomic factors play a role in food wastage. In wealthier nations, consumers often discard food out of preference for fresh items or lack of meal planning. In contrast, lower-income households may waste food due to financial constraints, making it challenging to utilize all available resources effectively.
        </p>

        <h1><u>Consequences of food wastage.</u></h1>
        <br>
        <h5><u> Resource Depletion:
        </u></h5>
        <p>When food is wasted, the resources used in its production, such as water, energy, and arable land, are also wasted. This resource depletion contributes to environmental degradation and has serious implications for a planet with finite resources.

        </p>
        <br>
        <h5><u>Greenhouse Gas Emissions:
        </u></h5>
        <p>Rotting food in landfills produces methane, a potent greenhouse gas that is significantly more effective at trapping heat in the atmosphere than carbon dioxide. Food wastage is a major contributor to methane emissions, exacerbating climate change.

        </p>
        <br>
        <h5><u>Biodiversity Loss:
        </u></h5>
        <p>The overproduction and wastage of food can lead to the destruction of natural habitats, contributing to biodiversity loss. Deforestation for agriculture and the extensive use of pesticides and fertilizers harm ecosystems and wildlife.

        </p>
        <br>
        <h5><u>Economic Loss:
        </u>Food wastage results in substantial economic losses at multiple levels of the supply chain. Farmers, retailers, and consumers collectively lose billions of dollars each year due to discarded food, which could otherwise be utilized more efficiently.

    </h5>
        <p></p>
        <br>
        <h5><u>Increased Food Prices:
        </u></h5>
        <p>The wastage of food exacerbates food prices as the costs of production and transportation are spread across the food that is actually consumed. This results in higher prices for consumers, impacting household budgets and potentially leading to food insecurity for some.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h5><u> Inefficiency in Resource Utilization:</u></h5>
        <p>When food resources are wasted, the valuable resources used in food production, such as water, energy, and labor, are also inefficiently utilized. This inefficiency exacerbates the strain on the planet's finite resources.
        </p>

    <h1><u>Out step for food conservation</u></h1>
    <br>
    <p>Today there is an endless Methods of food preservation . As humanity advances, it has quantified its efforts to achieve the durability of what it consumes.Since time immemorial, food conservation has been a priority issue for man. We always struggled to extend the life span of those foods that were consumed in abundance, such as meats and flours already ground, thus reaching methods based on salt and fermentation.With technological advances, archaic ways of prolonging the shelf life of food have remained in the past. With refrigeration processes, our food can even exceed the expiration date without risking our lives.

        However, cooling methods are not the only ones used today. The chemical components, from the cultivation to the massification and distribution, play a fundamental role even after the food is placed on supermarket shelves or tarantines.
        
        Every day new techniques are developed in order to preserve our health and our quality of life.
        
        In remote times, food production was scarce; And this had as a consequence that the little production was precarious due to the limited access of the same ones. This added to the factor of the annual seasons, since one time or another brings efficiencies or deficiency in the production.</p>
    <br>
    <h5><U>Cold Storage</U></h5>    
    <p>They are based on the freezing of foods, slowing the growth of bacteria, subjecting them to low temperatures.

        Freezing food is the art of preparing, packaging and freezing food at its peak of freshness. You can freeze most fresh vegetables and fruits, meats and fish, breads and pastries, clear soups and casseroles.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h5><u>refrigeration</u></h5>
    <p>In refrigeration it does not imply placing food below 0 degrees centigrade, but these are subject to a delay in those catalysts in their composition that prevent the bacteria from being born or reproduced.</p>
    <br>
    <h5><u>Freezing</u></h5>
    <p>Unlike refrigeration, foods are subjected to temperatures below zero, which causes all the liquid present in them to solidify, forming ice.

        This method allows the preservation of meat, poultry and fish for a very long time, even though its quality deteriorates after the expiration date.</p>
    <br>
    <h5><u>Ultra-Freezing</u></h5>
    <p>Taken to extremes, deep freezing is the method by which food is processed by immersion in liquids at very low temperature. It is not a domestic method.</p>
